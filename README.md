UQ CSSE2002 JAVA

Working on large and complex software systems and ensuring those systems remain maintainable requires disciplined, individual practices. Software must be well-specified, well-implemented and well-tested. This course covers concepts and techniques in modern programming languages that help support good practice (such as OO concepts, genericity and exception handling) with specific application to file IO and GUIs in Java.

# What I learned:
- write JUnit4 tests to debug
